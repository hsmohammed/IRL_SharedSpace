- put the world image in the project directory
- homography
- add 1 to every trajectory number


- smooth yawangle2 (5 frames)
- use difference in t+1 and t of yawangle 2
- shorten the length of trajectory (through new ID)

- why in trans_s where code the trans iusing three values state, action and new state?? should not be only just state and action without the state_new ???

- the error in numbering states and does this effect feature splitting 

- 
features_splittable <- matrix(rep(0,78125),nrow = 3125,ncol = 25)


for (i in 1:3125) {
  
  i1 <- (i-1)%%625
  i2 <- i1%%125
  i3 <- i2%%25
  i4 <- i3%%5
  
  j1 <- (i-1)%/%625
  j2 <- i1%/%125
  j3 <- i2%/%25
  j4 <- i3%/%5
  j5 <- i4
  
  features_splittable[i, j1+1] = 1
  features_splittable[i, j2+6] = 1
  features_splittable[i, j3+11] = 1
  features_splittable[i, j4+16] = 1
  features_splittable[i, j5+21] = 1
  
  
}
