- put the world image in the project directory
- homography
- add 1 to every trajectory number


- smooth yawangle2 (5 frames)
- use difference in t+1 and t of yawangle 2 for bike 
- shorten the length of trajectory (through new ID)
- remove negative speed and extreme values on acceleration
- to make sure, check yaw angle, does it has noise?

____ Delete rows with extreme values in Yaw diff in states and actions
